# Trend Analysis & Content Generation Platform Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. User-Centric Design
The user experience is paramount. The interface will be intuitive, efficient, and visually appealing. All design decisions must prioritize user needs and workflow efficiency over technical convenience.

### II. Reliability & Accuracy
The system must be highly reliable, providing accurate and trustworthy data from all integrated services (Google Trends, Ahrefs, Semrush, LLMs). Data integrity and service reliability are non-negotiable requirements.

### III. Maintainability & Scalability
The codebase will be clean, well-documented, and easy to maintain. The architecture will be designed to scale with a growing user base. Technical debt must be minimized and refactoring prioritized.

### IV. Modularity
The backend and frontend will be developed as separate, modular components to allow for independent development and future flexibility. Clear interfaces and contracts between modules are mandatory.

### V. Test-Driven Development (TDD)
Core backend logic will be developed with a TDD approach to ensure reliability. Tests must be written before implementation, and all critical paths must have comprehensive test coverage.

## Project Vision & Scope

### Vision
To create a sleek, reliable, and user-friendly platform that empowers content creators to make data-driven decisions. The system will provide a seamless workflow from initial topic ideation and profitability analysis to trend validation and final content creation, including robust keyword refinement.

### Target Audience
Content strategists, SEO specialists, affiliate marketers, and professional bloggers who need a powerful tool to streamline their content creation workflow.

### Key Technologies
- **Frontend**: React with a modern UI framework (e.g., Material-UI or Shadcn/ui) for a polished look and feel
- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI for its performance and ease of use
- **Database & Auth**: Supabase for its integrated database, authentication, and storage solutions
- **Deployment**: A modern cloud platform (e.g., Vercel for the frontend, Render or Fly.io for the backend)

## Development Workflow

### Project Structure

└── README.md                 # Project overview and setup instructions
```

### Development Principles
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: A CI/CD pipeline will be established from the beginning to automate testing and deployment
- **Code Reviews**: All code will be reviewed by at least one other developer before being merged
- **Monorepo Structure**: The frontend and backend code will be managed in a single monorepo to simplify dependency management and cross-functional development

## Quality Standards

### Performance Requirements
- **API Response Times**: Under 200ms for standard operations
- **Code Coverage**: Minimum 80% test coverage for backend services
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for frontend components
- **Security**: Regular security audits and dependency updates

### Communication Guidelines
- **Documentation**: All APIs, components, and significant features must be documented
- **Commit Messages**: Follow conventional commit format for clear change tracking
- **Issue Tracking**: Use GitHub Issues with proper labeling and milestone tracking
- **Code Reviews**: Minimum 2 approvals required for main branch merges

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other practices and serves as the foundation for all development decisions. Amendments require documentation, approval, and migration plan. All PRs and reviews must verify compliance with these principles. Complexity must be justified with clear business value.
