# Project Constitution

This document establishes the vision, values, and guiding principles for the new Trend Analysis & Content Generation Platform.

## 1. Project Vision

To create a sleek, reliable, and user-friendly platform that empowers content creators to make data-driven decisions. The system will provide a seamless workflow from initial topic ideation and profitability analysis to trend validation and final content creation, including robust keyword refinement.

## 2. Core Values

- **User-Centric Design**: The user experience is paramount. The interface will be intuitive, efficient, and visually appealing.
- **Reliability & Accuracy**: The system must be highly reliable, providing accurate and trustworthy data from all integrated services (Google Trends, Ahrefs, Semrush, LLMs).
- **Maintainability & Scalability**: The codebase will be clean, well-documented, and easy to maintain. The architecture will be designed to scale with a growing user base.
- **Modularity**: The backend and frontend will be developed as separate, modular components to allow for independent development and future flexibility.

## 3. Target Audience

Content strategists, SEO specialists, affiliate marketers, and professional bloggers who need a powerful tool to streamline their content creation workflow.

## 4. Key Technologies

- **Frontend**: React with a modern UI framework (e.g., Material-UI or Shadcn/ui) for a polished look and feel.
- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI for its performance and ease of use.
- **Database & Auth**: Supabase for its integrated database, authentication, and storage solutions.
- **Deployment**: A modern cloud platform (e.g., Vercel for the frontend, Render or Fly.io for the backend).

## 5. Development Principles

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Core backend logic will be developed with a TDD approach to ensure reliability.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: A CI/CD pipeline will be established from the beginning to automate testing and deployment.
- **Code Reviews**: All code will be reviewed by at least one other developer before being merged.
- **Monorepo Structure**: The frontend and backend code will be managed in a single monorepo to simplify dependency management and cross-functional development.

```

## 7. Quality Standards

- **Code Coverage**: Minimum 80% test coverage for backend services
- **Performance**: API response times under 200ms for standard operations
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for frontend components
- **Security**: Regular security audits and dependency updates

## 8. Communication Guidelines

- **Documentation**: All APIs, components, and significant features must be documented
- **Commit Messages**: Follow conventional commit format for clear change tracking
- **Issue Tracking**: Use GitHub Issues with proper labeling and milestone tracking
- **Code Reviews**: Minimum 2 approvals required for main branch merges
