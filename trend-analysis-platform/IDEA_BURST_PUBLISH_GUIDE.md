### 2. Select Ideas for Publishing
- Each idea card now has a **checkbox** next to the title
- Check the boxes for ideas you want to publish to Content Generation

### 3. Publish to Content Generation
- Click the **"Publish to Content Generation"** button
- A dialog will show the publishing progress

### API Integration

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"You must be logged in to publish ideas"**
   - Ensure you're authenticated in the application
   - Check if user session is valid

2. **"Please select at least one idea to publish"**
   - Check the checkboxes next to ideas you want to publish
   - Use "Select All" if you want to publish all ideas

3. **Database errors**
   - Check Supabase connection
   - Verify "Titles" table exists with proper schema
   - Check user permissions for table access

4. **Partial publish failures**
   - Some ideas may fail while others succeed
   - Check the publish results dialog for specific error messages
   - Retry failed ideas individually

### Debug Information
