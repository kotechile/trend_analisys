# Feature Specification: Enhanced Research Workflow Integration

## Overview
Enhance the existing TrendTap AI Research Workspace to provide a complete integrated workflow that allows users to:
1. Upload CSV files with trend data for manual trend analysis
2. Select specific trends from analysis results for focused content generation
3. Generate seed keywords based on selected trends and content ideas
4. Export keywords in formats suitable for external tools (Ahrefs, Semrush, Ubersuggest)
5. Upload and process results from external keyword research tools
6. Create a complete keyword analysis workflow with affiliate program integration

## Current Status
- Backend infrastructure already exists from previous spec-kit implementation
- All core services are implemented: keyword_service.py, trend_analysis_service.py, content_service.py, etc.
- Need to enhance existing services rather than create new ones
- Focus on frontend integration and workflow orchestration

## Key Requirements

### 1. Trend Selection & CSV Upload
- Add CSV upload functionality to existing trend_analysis_service.py
- Support manual trend data upload with validation
- Allow users to select specific trends from both LLM analysis and CSV uploads
- Store trend selections for content generation workflow

### 2. Keyword Enhancement Workflow
- Enhance existing keyword_service.py with seed keyword generation
- Generate keywords based on selected trends and content ideas
- Support multiple external tool formats (Ahrefs, Semrush, Ubersuggest)
- Create keyword cluster analysis and content strategy generation

### 3. External Tool Integration
- Add CSV processing for external tool results
- Normalize data from different tools (Ahrefs, Semrush, Ubersuggest)
- Generate export formats for external tools
- Process and analyze external keyword data

### 4. Frontend Workflow Orchestration
- Create enhanced frontend component that orchestrates existing backend services
- Implement step-by-step workflow with progress tracking
- Add trend selection UI with checkboxes and filtering
- Create keyword management interface with export/import functionality

## Technical Constraints
- Build upon existing backend services (keyword_service.py, trend_analysis_service.py, etc.)
- Maintain existing API contracts and database schemas
- Use existing authentication and user management
- Preserve existing caching and performance optimizations

## Success Criteria
- Users can upload CSV files with trend data
- Users can select specific trends for content generation
- Users can generate seed keywords and export them for external tools
- Users can upload external tool results and get integrated analysis
- Complete workflow takes less than 15 minutes end-to-end
- All existing functionality remains intact

## Integration Points
- Enhance keyword_service.py with new methods
- Enhance trend_analysis_service.py with CSV upload
- Create new frontend components that use existing APIs
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing features

## Clarifications

### Session 1
**Q: What specific CSV formats should be supported for trend data upload?**
A: Support standard CSV format with columns: trend_name, description, category, search_volume, competition_level, and date. Allow flexible column mapping for different data sources.

**Q: How should the trend selection interface work?**
A: Provide a multi-step interface with checkboxes for trend selection, filtering by category/volume, and preview of selected trends before proceeding to keyword generation.

**Q: What external tool formats need to be supported?**
A: Support CSV exports from Ahrefs, Semrush, and Ubersuggest with automatic format detection and data normalization.

**Q: How should keyword clustering work?**
A: Use semantic similarity and search intent to group keywords into clusters, with each cluster representing a content topic or theme.

**Q: What's the expected performance for the complete workflow?**
A: Target 15 minutes end-to-end for a typical workflow with 50-100 trends and 500-1000 keywords, with progress indicators throughout.
