# Tasks: Backend Database Supabase Integration

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/008-the-backend-database/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/supabase-api.yaml, quickstart.md

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory ✅
   → Extracted: Python 3.11+, Supabase Python SDK, FastAPI, Pydantic
   → Structure: Web application (backend/src/, frontend/src/)
2. Load design documents ✅
   → data-model.md: 4 entities (SupabaseClient, DatabaseOperation, AuthenticationContext, DataModel)
   → contracts/supabase-api.yaml: 5 endpoints (health, operations, real-time)
   → research.md: Supabase SDK integration decisions
   → quickstart.md: Test scenarios and migration strategy
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: Supabase client, dependencies, environment
   → Tests: Contract tests, integration tests (TDD mandatory)
   → Core: Models, services, API endpoints
   → Integration: Database operations, error handling, real-time
   → Polish: Performance, monitoring, documentation
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness ✅
```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify tests fail before implementing (TDD approach)
- Commit after each task
- All database operations must use Supabase SDK
- Maintain 80% test coverage requirement
- Performance target: <200ms API response times
- Error handling: Fail fast with clear messages, 401 redirect on auth failure, 60s timeout

## Validation Checklist
- [x] All contracts have corresponding tests (5 endpoints → 5 contract tests)
- [x] All entities have model tasks (4 entities → 4 model tasks)
- [x] All tests come before implementation (T006-T015 before T016-T028)
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent (different files)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [x] Migration strategy included
- [x] Error handling scenarios covered
- [x] Real-time features included
- [x] Performance requirements specified
