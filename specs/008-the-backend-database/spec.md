# Feature Specification: Backend Database Supabase Integration

**Feature Branch**: `008-the-backend-database`  
**Created**: 2024-12-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "The backend database is supabase. Every time when the supabase access is needed, it needs to be called with Supabase SDK instead of postgress"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale (<200ms API response requirement)
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements (Google Trends, Ahrefs, Semrush, LLMs)
   - Security/compliance needs
   - User experience and interface requirements
   - Data accuracy and reliability standards

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-01-27
- Q: When Supabase service is unavailable, what should the system behavior be? ‚Üí A: Fail fast with clear error message to user
- Q: How should the system handle Supabase authentication failures? ‚Üí A: Return 401 Unauthorized and redirect to login
- Q: What should occur when database queries timeout through Supabase SDK? ‚Üí A: Return timeout error after 60 seconds

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on the trend analysis platform, I need the backend to use Supabase as the database service so that all data operations are performed through the Supabase SDK instead of direct PostgreSQL connections, ensuring proper authentication, real-time capabilities, and managed database features.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the backend needs to access user data, **When** a database query is executed, **Then** the system MUST use Supabase SDK client instead of direct PostgreSQL connection
2. **Given** the backend needs to store trend analysis results, **When** data is persisted, **Then** the system MUST use Supabase SDK methods for database operations
3. **Given** the backend needs to retrieve trending topics, **When** querying the database, **Then** the system MUST authenticate through Supabase and use its query methods
4. **Given** the backend needs to update user preferences, **When** modifying user data, **Then** the system MUST use Supabase SDK for all CRUD operations
5. **Given** the backend needs to perform real-time operations, **When** subscribing to data changes, **Then** the system MUST use Supabase real-time features through the SDK

### Edge Cases
- When Supabase service is unavailable, the system MUST fail fast with clear error message to user
- When Supabase authentication failures occur, the system MUST return 401 Unauthorized and redirect to login
- When database queries timeout through Supabase SDK, the system MUST return timeout error after 60 seconds

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST use Supabase SDK for all database operations instead of direct PostgreSQL connections
- **FR-002**: System MUST authenticate with Supabase service before performing any database operations
- **FR-003**: System MUST use Supabase client methods for all CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- **FR-004**: System MUST leverage Supabase real-time features for live data updates when applicable
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle Supabase-specific error responses and connection issues
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain Supabase connection pooling and session management
- **FR-007**: System MUST use Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data access control
- **FR-008**: System MUST validate data through Supabase schema constraints before operations
- **FR-009**: System MUST use Supabase query builder or SQL functions instead of raw SQL when possible
- **FR-010**: System MUST implement proper Supabase client initialization and configuration management

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Supabase Client**: Centralized database connection and operation handler that manages authentication, queries, and real-time subscriptions
- **Database Operations**: All data persistence and retrieval activities that must be routed through Supabase SDK methods
- **Authentication Context**: Supabase session and user authentication state that enables secure database access
- **Data Models**: Business entities (users, trends, analyses) that are stored and retrieved through Supabase database tables
