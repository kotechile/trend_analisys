# Implementation Plan: Backend Database Supabase Integration

**Branch**: `008-the-backend-database` | **Date**: 2025-01-27 | **Spec**: `/specs/008-the-backend-database/spec.md`
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/008-the-backend-database/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Replace all direct PostgreSQL connections with Supabase SDK integration in the backend database layer, ensuring proper authentication, real-time capabilities, and managed database features. This includes implementing Supabase client initialization, CRUD operations through SDK methods, error handling for service unavailability and authentication failures, and timeout management for database queries.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+ (FastAPI backend)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Supabase Python SDK, FastAPI, Pydantic  
**Storage**: Supabase (PostgreSQL with managed features)  
**Testing**: pytest with 80% coverage requirement  
**Target Platform**: Linux server (cloud deployment)  
**Project Type**: web (frontend + backend detected)  
**Performance Goals**: <200ms API response times, 1000+ concurrent users  
**Constraints**: 60-second query timeout, fail-fast error handling, 401 redirect on auth failure  
**Scale/Scope**: Backend database layer integration, existing trend analysis platform

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### User-Centric Design Gates
- [x] Interface design prioritizes user workflow efficiency (backend database layer)
- [x] All user interactions are intuitive and visually appealing (transparent to users)
- [x] User experience requirements are clearly defined (fail-fast with clear errors)

### Reliability & Accuracy Gates
- [x] Data sources (Supabase) are properly integrated
- [x] Data validation and error handling are comprehensive (timeout, auth, service unavailability)
- [x] Service reliability requirements are met (60s timeout, fail-fast behavior)

### Maintainability & Scalability Gates
- [x] Code structure follows clean architecture principles (Supabase SDK abstraction)
- [x] Documentation is comprehensive and up-to-date (will be generated)
- [x] Architecture supports expected user growth (Supabase managed scaling)

### Modularity Gates
- [x] Frontend and backend are properly separated (backend-only change)
- [x] Clear interfaces between modules are defined (Supabase SDK interface)
- [x] Dependencies are minimized and well-defined (Supabase SDK only)

### TDD Gates
- [x] Test coverage meets minimum 80% requirement (pytest requirement)
- [x] Tests are written before implementation (TDD approach)
- [x] All critical paths have comprehensive test coverage (database operations)

```

**Structure Decision**: Web application structure with backend and frontend separation. The Supabase integration will primarily affect the backend database layer in `backend/src/core/` and `backend/src/services/`, with API routes in `backend/src/api/`.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh cursor`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract endpoint → contract test task [P]
- Each data model entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Supabase client initialization → setup task
- Error handling scenarios → test tasks
- Migration strategy → implementation tasks

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Supabase client → models → services → API routes
- Migration order: Read operations → Write operations → Real-time features
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md covering:
- Supabase client setup and configuration
- Database operation implementations
- Error handling and timeout management
- Real-time subscription features
- Migration from PostgreSQL to Supabase
- Comprehensive testing suite
- Performance optimization
- Monitoring and observability

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)

- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
