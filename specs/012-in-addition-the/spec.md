# Feature Specification: Enhanced Idea Burst Page with Selection Indicators

**Feature Branch**: `012-in-addition-the`  
**Created**: 2024-12-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "in addition, the front end's idea Burst page should include indicators that help users select the best ideas. For software ideas we do not need any keyword analysis."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale (<200ms API response requirement)
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements (Google Trends, Ahrefs, Semrush, LLMs)
   - Security/compliance needs
   - User experience and interface requirements
   - Data accuracy and reliability standards

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a content creator, I want to see visual indicators on the Idea Burst page that help me quickly identify and select the best content ideas, so I can prioritize my content creation efforts and focus on the most promising opportunities.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is on the Idea Burst page, **When** they view the list of generated ideas, **Then** they should see clear visual indicators showing which ideas are most promising
2. **Given** a user sees multiple content ideas, **When** they want to compare ideas, **Then** they should be able to see ranking indicators and selection criteria
3. **Given** a user is viewing software-related ideas, **When** they interact with these ideas, **Then** they should not see keyword analysis data as it's not relevant
4. **Given** a user wants to select the best ideas, **When** they use the selection indicators, **Then** they should be able to easily identify and choose the most valuable content opportunities

### Edge Cases
- What happens when no indicators can be calculated for certain ideas?
- How does the system handle ideas with insufficient data for indicator calculation?
- What happens when users want to customize which indicators are displayed?
- How does the system handle different types of content ideas (articles vs software vs tools)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display visual selection indicators on the Idea Burst page to help users identify the best content ideas
- **FR-002**: System MUST show different types of indicators based on content idea type (article ideas vs software ideas)
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide ranking indicators that help users prioritize content ideas by potential value
- **FR-004**: System MUST exclude keyword analysis indicators for software-related content ideas
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow users to filter and sort ideas based on selection indicators
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide clear visual cues (colors, icons, badges) to indicate idea quality and potential
- **FR-007**: System MUST show comparative indicators when multiple ideas are displayed
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow users to select and save their preferred ideas based on indicator guidance
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what specific indicators should be shown for article ideas vs software ideas?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: how should indicators be calculated when data is incomplete or unavailable?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Content Idea**: Represents a generated content idea with associated metadata and indicators
- **Selection Indicator**: Represents a visual or numerical indicator that helps users evaluate idea quality
- **Idea Burst Session**: Contains the collection of generated ideas and user selections for a specific session
