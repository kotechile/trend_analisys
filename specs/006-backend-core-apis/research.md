- **Secondary**: Web scraping with rate limiting for networks without APIs
- **Fallback**: CSV upload for manual program data
- **Caching**: Redis-based caching with 1-hour TTL for program data

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Single aggregator service**: Rejected due to limited network coverage and higher costs
- **Manual data entry**: Rejected due to maintenance overhead and data staleness
- **Webhook-based updates**: Rejected due to inconsistent network support

**Technical Details**:
- Rate limiting: 100 requests/minute per network
- Retry logic: Exponential backoff with 3 attempts
- Data validation: Schema validation for commission rates and program details
- Error handling: Graceful degradation with cached data fallback
