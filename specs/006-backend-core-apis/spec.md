# Feature Specification: TrendTap - AI Research Workspace

**Feature Branch**: `006-backend-core-apis`  
**Created**: 2025-10-02  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create TrendTap - the only AI research workspace that (a) guarantees every article idea is pre-wired to a high-paying affiliate programme, (b) scores the idea on future demand (Google Trends + LLM extrapolation) and (c) auto-builds the exact keyword cluster you need to rank‚Äîbefore you write a sentence. The platform should support real-time affiliate network queries, hybrid trend forecasting, CSV keyword uploads, and multi-LLM integration for content generation."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature description provided and validated
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors (content creators), actions (research, analyze, generate), data (keywords, trends, content), constraints (CSV upload, multi-LLM)
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All aspects clarified - no ambiguities remain
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Complete user workflow from registration to publishing defined
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí 48 testable functional requirements created
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí 6 core entities identified: User, AffiliateResearch, TrendAnalysis, KeywordData, ContentIdeas, ContentCalendar
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí All checks passed - no implementation details, focused on user value
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale (<200ms API response requirement)
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements (Google Trends, Linkup, LLMs)
   - Security/compliance needs
   - User experience and interface requirements
   - Data accuracy and reliability standards

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a content strategist, SEO specialist, or affiliate marketer, I want to use TrendTap to guarantee every article idea is pre-wired to a high-paying affiliate programme, score ideas on future demand using hybrid forecasting, and auto-build exact keyword clusters for ranking‚Äîall before writing a sentence‚Äîso that I can maximize content ROI with data-driven decisions in under 15 minutes.

### 30-Second Elevator Pitch
"TrendTap" is the only AI research workspace that (a) guarantees every article idea is pre-wired to a high-paying affiliate programme, (b) scores the idea on future demand (Google Trends + LLM extrapolation) and (c) auto-builds the exact keyword cluster you need to rank‚Äîbefore you write a sentence.

### USER WORKFLOW (5 STEPS, <15 min)

#### Step 0 ‚Üí Seed
**Given** a user visits TrendTap, **When** they enter a broad niche ("home coffee roasting") or let the AI scan their existing blog to suggest gaps, **Then** the system provides seed topics and identifies content gaps.

#### Step 1 ‚Üí Monetisation First
**Given** a user has a seed topic, **When** they initiate affiliate research, **Then** the system queries 14 affiliate networks (Share-a-sale, Impact, Amazon, CJ, Partnerize, etc.) in real time and returns:
- Top 10 programmes by EPC, reversal rate, cookie length
- Average commission $, conversion %, landing-page compliance flags
- User can tick programmes they're willing to promote (becomes commercial kernel for every idea)

#### Step 2 ‚Üí Trend Validation
**Given** a user has selected affiliate programmes, **When** they submit topics for trend analysis, **Then** the hybrid forecast engine:
- A. Google Trends API (or CSV upload if API unavailable) ‚Üí historical 5-year data
- B. LLM extrapolation layer (fine-tuned on 400k trending queries) ‚Üí 12-month forecast with 80% CI
- C. News-cycle booster ‚Üí scans Reddit, Twitter, TikTok, RSS for acceleration signals
- **Output**: "Opportunity score" (0-100) = f(forecasted growth, seasonality, affiliate depth, SERP volatility)

#### Step 3 ‚Üí Idea Burst
**Given** a user picks any opportunity > 70, **When** they click to expand, **Then** the system generates:
- 5 article angles (how-to, vs, listicle, pain-point, story)
- 3-5 software solution ideas (calculators, tools, generators, analyzers)
- Each angle ‚Üí headline formulas (CoSchedule scored) + EEAT hooks
- Each software idea ‚Üí tool description, target keywords, development complexity score
- Each headline ‚Üí keyword cluster (see Step 4)

#### Step 4 ‚Üí Keyword Armoury
**Given** a user has content ideas, **When** they access keyword tools, **Then** they can:
- Upload Ahrefs/SEMrush CSV ‚Üí system keeps parent topic, strips junk, adds gap analysis vs SERP
- OR let built-in KW module crawl (uses DataForSEO $0.0008/line)
- **Returns**: Priority score = (affiliate EPC √ó search intent √ó SERP weakness) / keyword difficulty
- Word count, heading structure, NLP terms, People-Also-Ask snippets, internal-link suggestions
- One-click push to Google Doc / Notion / WordPress draft with SurferSEO/Frase API merged

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a new user visits TrendTap, **When** they register with email and password, **Then** they receive confirmation email, verify account, and access the main workspace.

2. **Given** a logged-in user enters a niche topic, **When** they initiate affiliate research, **Then** the system queries 14 affiliate networks in real-time and displays top 10 programmes with EPC, reversal rates, and compliance flags.

3. **Given** a user has selected affiliate programmes, **When** they submit topics for trend validation, **Then** the system runs hybrid forecasting (Google Trends + LLM + news signals) and returns opportunity scores (0-100).

4. **Given** a user picks an opportunity > 70, **When** they click to expand, **Then** the system generates 5 article angles with CoSchedule-scored headlines and EEAT hooks, plus 3-5 software solution ideas with development complexity scores.

5. **Given** a user has content ideas, **When** they access keyword tools, **Then** they can upload CSV files or use built-in crawling, and receive priority-scored keyword clusters with SEO recommendations.

6. **Given** a user has keyword clusters, **When** they select content ideas, **Then** the system provides one-click export to Google Docs/Notion/WordPress with SurferSEO/Frase integration.

7. **Given** a user is managing their workspace, **When** they view their research history, **Then** they can search, filter, export reports, and track performance metrics.

8. **Given** a user has completed research, **When** they access the content calendar, **Then** they can schedule content with publication dates, track status, and manage their content pipeline.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user uploads an invalid CSV file format for keyword data?
- How does the system handle external API failures (Google Trends, LLM services)?
- What happens when a user's affiliate research returns no results for an obscure topic?
- How does the system handle concurrent trend analysis requests from multiple users?
- What happens when a user tries to schedule content for a past date?
- How does the system handle duplicate content ideas, software solutions, or keywords?
- What happens when LLM services are rate-limited or unavailable?
- How does the system handle very large CSV files (10,000+ keywords)?
- What happens when a user's session expires during a long-running analysis?
- How does the system handle conflicting data from different external sources?
- What happens when software solution complexity scores are inconsistent with technical requirements?
- How does the system handle software solutions that require external APIs or databases?
- What happens when a user requests software solutions for highly regulated industries (finance, healthcare)?
- How does the system validate the technical feasibility of generated software solutions?
