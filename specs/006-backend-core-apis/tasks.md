# Tasks: TrendTap - AI Research Workspace

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/006-backend-core-apis/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Implementation plan loaded successfully
   → Extract: FastAPI + React tech stack, web app structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: 7 entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: 3 files → contract test tasks
   → research.md: 9 research decisions → setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project init, dependencies, linting, monorepo structure
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests (TDD mandatory)
   → Core: models, services, API endpoints
   → Integration: DB, middleware, external APIs (14 affiliate networks, Google Trends, DataForSEO)
   → UI/UX: React components, Material-UI, user interface
   → Polish: unit tests, performance (<200ms), docs, security audits
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All contracts have tests? ✅
   → All entities have models? ✅
   → All endpoints implemented? ✅
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

```
# Launch contract tests together:
Task: "Contract test POST /api/affiliate/research in backend/tests/contract/test_affiliate_research.py"
Task: "Contract test POST /api/trends/analyze in backend/tests/contract/test_trend_analysis.py"
Task: "Contract test POST /api/keywords/upload in backend/tests/contract/test_keyword_management.py"
Task: "Contract test POST /api/content/generate in backend/tests/contract/test_content_generation.py"

# Launch model creation together:
Task: "User model in backend/src/models/user.py"
Task: "AffiliateResearch model in backend/src/models/affiliate_research.py"
Task: "TrendAnalysis model in backend/src/models/trend_analysis.py"
Task: "KeywordData model in backend/src/models/keyword_data.py"

# Launch service creation together:
Task: "AffiliateService for 14 network integrations in backend/src/services/affiliate_service.py"
Task: "TrendService for Google Trends + LLM forecasting in backend/src/services/trend_service.py"
Task: "KeywordService for CSV processing + DataForSEO in backend/src/services/keyword_service.py"
Task: "ContentService for article generation in backend/src/services/content_service.py"
```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task
- Backend-first approach: API before frontend
- TDD mandatory: all tests must fail before implementation
- Performance target: <200ms API response time
- Security: JWT authentication, rate limiting, input validation
- Scalability: 100+ concurrent users, horizontal scaling

## Task Generation Rules
*Applied during main() execution*

1. **From Contracts**:
   - Each contract file → contract test task [P] ✅
   - Each endpoint → implementation task ✅
   
2. **From Data Model**:
   - Each entity → model creation task [P] ✅
   - Relationships → service layer tasks ✅
   
3. **From User Stories**:
   - Each story → integration test [P] ✅
   - Quickstart scenarios → validation tasks ✅

4. **Ordering**:
   - Setup → Tests → Models → Services → Endpoints → Polish ✅
   - Dependencies block parallel execution ✅

## Validation Checklist
*GATE: Checked by main() before returning*

- [x] All contracts have corresponding tests
- [x] All entities have model tasks
- [x] All tests come before implementation
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task

**Status**: ✅ Tasks generated successfully - 130 tasks ready for execution
