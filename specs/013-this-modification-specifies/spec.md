## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale (<200ms API response requirement)
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements (Google Trends, Ahrefs, Semrush, LLMs)
   - Security/compliance needs
   - User experience and interface requirements
   - Data accuracy and reliability standards

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a content creator or SEO specialist, I want to access enhanced trend analysis and keyword research capabilities powered by DataForSEO APIs so that I can make data-driven decisions about content topics and keyword targeting strategies.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have completed affiliate research with identified subtopics, **When** I access the new "Trend Analysis - DataForSEO" page, **Then** I can view graphical trend data for all my subtopics showing search interest over time and regional popularity
2. **Given** I am viewing trend data for my subtopics, **When** I select multiple subtopics for comparison, **Then** I can see side-by-side trend comparisons with clear visualizations
3. **Given** I am on the trend analysis page, **When** I request new subtopic suggestions, **Then** the system proposes related trending topics based on current search data
4. **Given** I have seed keywords from the Idea Burst module, **When** I access the enhanced keyword research, **Then** I can see a prioritized list of low-competition keywords with difficulty scores, search volume, and commercial intent metrics
5. **Given** I have set my maximum keyword difficulty threshold, **When** the system processes my seed keywords, **Then** I only see keywords that meet my competition criteria
6. **Given** I am using the keyword research feature, **When** I view keyword suggestions, **Then** I can see 12-month trend data to identify growing opportunities

### Edge Cases
- What happens when DataForSEO API is unavailable or returns no data for a subtopic?
- How does the system handle subtopics that are too niche or have insufficient search volume?
- What happens when the user's maximum keyword difficulty setting filters out all available keywords?
- How does the system handle API rate limits or quota exceeded scenarios?
- What happens when seed keywords are too long-tail and return no results from the keyword ideas API?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST create complete backups of existing "Trend Analysis" and "Idea Burst" pages before making any modifications
- **FR-002**: System MUST create new working copies named "Trend Analysis - DataForSEO" and "Idea Burst - DataForSEO" for the enhanced functionality
- **FR-003**: System MUST integrate with DataForSEO Trends API to fetch keyword popularity trends over time for all subtopics from affiliate research
- **FR-004**: System MUST display trend data in a rich graphical dashboard showing search interest over time and regional popularity
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow users to select and compare multiple subtopics based on their trend data
- **FR-006**: System MUST automatically propose new related subtopics that are currently trending or show high growth potential
- **FR-007**: System MUST integrate with DataForSEO Labs API for keyword data retrieval using seed keywords from Idea Burst
- **FR-008**: System MUST filter keyword results based on user-defined maximum organic Keyword Difficulty level
- **FR-009**: System MUST prioritize keywords based on commercial intent metrics (CPC, Competition value) and search volume/trend data
- **FR-010**: System MUST improve the seed keyword generator to avoid overly long-tail keywords that may not yield sufficient API data

- **FR-014**: System MUST display 12-month search volume trend data for keyword research results
- **FR-015**: System MUST maintain data integrity and comply with non-deletion requirements throughout the implementation

- **Trend Data**: Represents keyword popularity over time, location data, and demographic information for subtopics
- **Keyword Research Data**: Represents search volume, keyword difficulty, CPC, competition value, and trend data for keyword suggestions
- **Subtopic**: Represents topics identified through affiliate research that serve as input for trend analysis
- **Seed Keywords**: Represents user-provided keywords that serve as input for keyword research expansion
