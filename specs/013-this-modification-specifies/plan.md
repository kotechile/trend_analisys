# Implementation Plan: DataForSEO API Integration for Enhanced Trend Analysis and Keyword Research

**Branch**: `013-this-modification-specifies` | **Date**: 2025-01-14 | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/013-this-modification-specifies/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Integration of DataForSEO Trends and Labs APIs to enhance existing Trend Analysis and Keyword Research capabilities. The feature will create new DataForSEO-powered pages while preserving all existing functionality through comprehensive backup and non-deletion compliance. The implementation will provide rich graphical dashboards for trend visualization and intelligent keyword research with commercial intent prioritization.

## Technical Context

**Primary Dependencies**: FastAPI 0.104.1, React 18.2.0, Material-UI 5.15.0, Supabase 2.0.2  
**Storage**: Supabase (PostgreSQL), Redis 5.0.1 for caching  
**Testing**: pytest 7.4.3, vitest 1.0.0, @testing-library/react 13.4.0  
**Target Platform**: Web application (Linux server deployment)  
**Project Type**: Web application (frontend + backend monorepo)  
**Performance Goals**: <200ms API response times, 80% test coverage  
**Constraints**: Must preserve existing functionality, non-deletion policy, DataForSEO API rate limits  
**Scale/Scope**: Content creators and SEO specialists, enhanced trend analysis and keyword research features

### Modularity Gates
- [x] Frontend and backend are properly separated (existing monorepo structure)
- [x] Clear interfaces between modules are defined (API contracts will be generated)
- [x] Dependencies are minimized and well-defined (DataForSEO API integration)

### TDD Gates
- [x] Test coverage meets minimum 80% requirement (pytest and vitest configured)

**Structure Decision**: Web application monorepo with separate frontend and backend modules. The DataForSEO integration will be implemented as new modules within the existing structure, preserving all current functionality through backup and non-deletion compliance.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh cursor`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**Task Categories**:
1. **Backup & Setup Tasks** (1-5): Create backups, setup new pages
2. **Data Model Tasks** (6-10): Create entities, validation, database schema
3. **API Integration Tasks** (11-15): DataForSEO API client, error handling
4. **Backend Service Tasks** (16-20): Trend analysis, keyword research services
5. **Frontend Component Tasks** (21-25): React components, Material-UI integration
6. **Testing Tasks** (26-30): Contract tests, integration tests, E2E tests

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
