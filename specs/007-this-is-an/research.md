# Research: Frontend Issues Fix

**Feature**: Frontend Issues Fix  
**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Complete

## Research Tasks & Findings

### 1. React Router Integration Issues
**Task**: Research React Router best practices for tab-based navigation with dynamic routing

**Decision**: Use React Router v6 with `useNavigate` and `useLocation` hooks for tab state management

**Rationale**: 
- Current implementation uses `getCurrentTab()` function that maps routes to tab indices
- This approach is fragile and doesn't handle direct URL navigation properly
- React Router v6 provides better state management and URL synchronization

**Alternatives considered**:
- State-based tab management (rejected - doesn't support direct URL access)
- Custom routing solution (rejected - reinventing the wheel)

### 2. Material-UI Component Integration
**Task**: Research Material-UI component patterns for complex workflow interfaces

**Decision**: Use Material-UI v5 with `Tabs`, `Stepper`, `Card`, and `Dialog` components

**Rationale**:
- Current implementation already uses Material-UI but may have missing dependencies
- Stepper component is ideal for multi-step workflow visualization
- Card components provide consistent content organization

**Alternatives considered**:
- Custom UI components (rejected - too much development overhead)
- Other UI libraries (rejected - Material-UI already integrated)

### 3. React Context State Management
**Task**: Research React Context patterns for complex multi-step workflow state

**Decision**: Use `useReducer` with Context API for workflow state management

**Rationale**:
- Current `EnhancedWorkflowContext` uses `useReducer` which is appropriate for complex state
- Context provides global state access across workflow components
- Reducer pattern handles complex state transitions cleanly

**Alternatives considered**:
- Redux (rejected - overkill for this use case)
- Local component state (rejected - doesn't scale across workflow steps)

### 4. API Integration Patterns
**Task**: Research best practices for React API integration with error handling

**Decision**: Use Axios with React Query for API state management and caching

**Rationale**:
- Current implementation uses fetch() which lacks built-in error handling
- React Query provides caching, background updates, and error states
- Axios provides better request/response interceptors

**Alternatives considered**:
- SWR (rejected - React Query has better TypeScript support)
- Native fetch (rejected - requires too much boilerplate)

### 5. Component Architecture Patterns
**Task**: Research component architecture for multi-step workflow interfaces

**Decision**: Use compound component pattern with specialized workflow step components

**Rationale**:
- Each workflow step (Topic Decomposition, Affiliate Research, etc.) should be a separate component
- Main workflow component orchestrates step navigation and state
- Specialized components handle step-specific logic and UI

**Alternatives considered**:
- Monolithic workflow component (rejected - too complex and hard to maintain)
- Page-based routing (rejected - doesn't fit workflow metaphor)

### 6. Error Handling Strategies
**Task**: Research error handling patterns for React applications with external API dependencies

**Decision**: Implement error boundaries, API error handling, and user-friendly error messages

**Rationale**:
- Error boundaries catch component errors and prevent app crashes
- API error handling provides specific error messages for different failure types
- User-friendly messages help users understand and recover from errors

**Alternatives considered**:
- Silent error handling (rejected - poor user experience)
- Generic error messages (rejected - not helpful for debugging)

### 7. Performance Optimization
**Task**: Research performance optimization techniques for React workflow applications

**Decision**: Use React.memo, useMemo, useCallback, and code splitting

**Rationale**:
- React.memo prevents unnecessary re-renders of workflow step components
- useMemo and useCallback optimize expensive calculations and event handlers
- Code splitting reduces initial bundle size for better loading performance

**Alternatives considered**:
- No optimization (rejected - poor user experience with large workflows)
- Over-optimization (rejected - premature optimization)
