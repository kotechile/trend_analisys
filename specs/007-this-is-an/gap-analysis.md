## Conclusion

The gap analysis reveals that while TrendTap has a solid foundation, significant enhancements are needed to meet the new high-level workflow requirements. The implementation strategy focuses on building core services first, then enhancing the user experience. With 45 tasks across 4 phases, the complete implementation is estimated to take 4 weeks.

The most critical gaps are topic decomposition, affiliate persistence, and Google Trends integration, which should be addressed first. The frontend enhancements can be implemented in parallel with backend services to optimize development time.

This analysis provides a clear roadmap for closing the gaps and delivering the enhanced research workflow that meets all the specified requirements.
