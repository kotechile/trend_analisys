# Feature Specification: Enhanced Research Workflow with Topic Decomposition and Affiliate Integration

**Feature Branch**: `007-this-is-an`  
**Created**: 2024-12-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "This is an update of the high level workflow of the program that needs to be incorporated in the spec-kit specs: Based on the user search query, the system will use an LLM to split the topic into multiple related subtopics (for example if the search is "Cars for the east coast', the system can create sub terms related to that like 'Electric cards in california', 'car dealers', 'car parts', 'car repair', 'car hacks', etc.."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale (<200ms API response requirement)
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements (Google Trends, Ahrefs, Semrush, LLMs)
   - Security/compliance needs
   - User experience and interface requirements
   - Data accuracy and reliability standards

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a content creator or affiliate marketer, I want to input a broad search query and have the system automatically decompose it into related subtopics, find relevant affiliate offers, analyze trends, and generate comprehensive content ideas with optimized keywords, so that I can efficiently create targeted content strategies with monetization opportunities.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user enters a search query "Cars for the east coast", **When** the system processes the query, **Then** it should generate multiple related subtopics like "Electric cars in California", "car dealers", "car parts", "car repair", "car hacks", etc.

2. **Given** the system has generated subtopics, **When** the user requests affiliate research, **Then** the system should use LinkUp and LLM to find the best affiliate offers with access links or instructions.

3. **Given** affiliate offers have been found, **When** the user proceeds to trend analysis, **Then** the system should either use Google Trends API (future) or provide search terms for manual Google Trends research with CSV upload capability.

4. **Given** trend analysis results are available, **When** the user selects specific trends, **Then** the system should generate comprehensive blog ideas and software ideas with enhanced keywords.

5. **Given** the user has seed keywords, **When** they export them to external tools (Semrush/Ahrefs), **Then** the system should allow them to upload the resulting CSV back for keyword enrichment.

6. **Given** external keyword data has been uploaded, **When** the system processes the data, **Then** it should enrich existing ideas with the best keywords found, including title, description, enhanced keywords, and affiliate offers.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the LLM fails to generate meaningful subtopics from a vague query?
- How does the system handle when no relevant affiliate offers are found for a subtopic?
- What happens when Google Trends data is unavailable or incomplete?
- How does the system handle CSV files with invalid or incomplete data from external tools?
- What happens when the user's API keys for external services expire or are invalid?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
