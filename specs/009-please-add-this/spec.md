# Feature Specification: Google Autocomplete Integration for Enhanced Topic Research

**Feature Branch**: `009-please-add-this`  
**Created**: 2024-12-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "please add this to the project specification"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale (<200ms API response requirement)
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements (Google Trends, Ahrefs, Semrush, LLMs)
   - Security/compliance needs
   - User experience and interface requirements
   - Data accuracy and reliability standards

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an affiliate marketer, I want to discover more relevant and trending subtopics for my research so that I can find better affiliate opportunities and create content that matches what people are actually searching for.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user enters a topic like "fitness equipment", **When** they request topic decomposition, **Then** the system should return subtopics enhanced with real-time search suggestions from Google Autocomplete
2. **Given** a user wants to research affiliate opportunities, **When** they use the enhanced topic research, **Then** they should see subtopics with search volume indicators and relevance scores
3. **Given** a user is comparing different research methods, **When** they request a method comparison, **Then** they should see side-by-side results from LLM-only, autocomplete-only, and hybrid approaches
4. **Given** the system encounters rate limiting from Google, **When** autocomplete requests are blocked, **Then** the system should gracefully fall back to LLM-only decomposition
5. **Given** a user wants to validate topic relevance, **When** they see autocomplete suggestions, **Then** they should be able to identify trending topics and high-search-volume keywords

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Google Autocomplete API is unavailable or returns empty results?
- How does the system handle rate limiting and potential IP blocking from Google?
- What occurs when autocomplete suggestions are irrelevant or spam?
- How does the system perform when processing very broad or very specific topics?
- What happens when autocomplete data conflicts with LLM-generated subtopics?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST integrate Google Autocomplete API to gather real-time search suggestions for topic research
- **FR-002**: System MUST combine autocomplete data with LLM-generated subtopics to create enhanced topic decomposition
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to see relevance scores and search volume indicators for each subtopic
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide method comparison functionality showing LLM-only, autocomplete-only, and hybrid approaches
- **FR-005**: System MUST implement rate limiting to prevent Google API blocking
- **FR-006**: System MUST gracefully handle autocomplete API failures and fall back to LLM-only decomposition
- **FR-007**: System MUST filter and clean autocomplete suggestions to remove irrelevant or spam content
- **FR-008**: System MUST display autocomplete suggestions alongside subtopics for user reference
- **FR-009**: System MUST track processing time and performance metrics for autocomplete integration
- **FR-010**: System MUST allow users to select which subtopics to proceed with for affiliate research

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Enhanced Subtopic**: Represents a topic subdivision with autocomplete validation, containing title, search volume indicators, relevance score, and source attribution
- **Autocomplete Result**: Represents Google Autocomplete API response data, containing query, suggestions list, total count, and processing time
- **Method Comparison**: Represents side-by-side analysis of different decomposition approaches, containing results from LLM-only, autocomplete-only, and hybrid methods
- **Search Volume Indicator**: Represents metrics derived from autocomplete data that suggest topic popularity and search demand
