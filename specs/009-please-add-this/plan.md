# Implementation Plan: Google Autocomplete Integration for Enhanced Topic Research

**Branch**: `009-please-add-this` | **Date**: 2024-12-19 | **Spec**: `/specs/009-please-add-this/spec.md`
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/009-please-add-this/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Integrate Google Autocomplete API with existing LLM-based topic decomposition to enhance affiliate research by providing real-time search suggestions, relevance scoring, and method comparison capabilities. The feature will combine Google's autocomplete data with AI intelligence to deliver more accurate and trending subtopics for affiliate marketing research.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.11, TypeScript/React 18  
**Primary Dependencies**: FastAPI, aiohttp, React Query, Material-UI  
**Storage**: Supabase (existing), in-memory caching for autocomplete results  
**Testing**: pytest, Jest, React Testing Library  
**Target Platform**: Linux server (backend), Web browser (frontend)  
**Project Type**: web (frontend + backend)  
**Performance Goals**: <200ms API response time, <2s total topic decomposition  
**Constraints**: Rate limiting to prevent Google API blocking, graceful fallback to LLM-only  
**Scale/Scope**: 1k+ concurrent users, 10k+ topic decompositions per day

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### User-Centric Design Gates

### Reliability & Accuracy Gates
- [x] Data sources (Google Autocomplete, LLMs) are properly integrated with fallback mechanisms
- [x] Data validation and error handling are comprehensive (rate limiting, API failure handling)
- [x] Service reliability requirements are met (graceful degradation to LLM-only)

### Maintainability & Scalability Gates
- [x] Code structure follows clean architecture principles (enhanced service layer)
- [x] Documentation is comprehensive and up-to-date (integration guide provided)
- [x] Architecture supports expected user growth (rate limiting, caching strategies)

### Modularity Gates
- [x] Frontend and backend are properly separated (enhanced API endpoints)
- [x] Clear interfaces between modules are defined (autocomplete service, enhanced decomposition)
- [x] Dependencies are minimized and well-defined (aiohttp for async requests)

### TDD Gates
- [x] Test coverage meets minimum 80% requirement (comprehensive test suite planned)
- [x] Tests are written before implementation (contract tests, integration tests)
- [x] All critical paths have comprehensive test coverage (autocomplete, LLM, hybrid approaches)

**Structure Decision**: Web application structure with separate frontend and backend modules. The enhanced topic decomposition service extends the existing backend architecture, while the frontend component integrates with the existing workflow system. Shared types ensure consistency between frontend and backend implementations.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh cursor`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

**Specific Task Categories for Google Autocomplete Integration**:

1. **Backend Service Tasks**:
   - Enhanced topic decomposition service implementation
   - Google Autocomplete integration service
   - Rate limiting and error handling
   - Caching and performance optimization

2. **API Contract Tasks**:
   - Enhanced topics API endpoints
   - Request/response validation
   - Error handling and status codes
   - Rate limiting middleware

3. **Frontend Component Tasks**:
   - Enhanced topic decomposition component
   - Method comparison UI
   - Relevance scoring display
   - Autocomplete suggestions visualization

4. **Testing Tasks**:
   - Unit tests for autocomplete service
   - Integration tests for hybrid approach
   - Contract tests for API endpoints
   - End-to-end workflow tests

5. **Documentation Tasks**:
   - API documentation updates
   - Integration guide completion
   - User experience documentation
   - Performance monitoring setup

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
