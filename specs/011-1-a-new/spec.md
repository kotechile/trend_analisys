# Feature Specification: Keyword Analysis with Ahrefs Data

**Feature Branch**: `011-1-a-new`  
**Created**: 2024-12-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "1) A new functionality for keyword analysis with the uploaded ahrefs keywords needs to be implemented: Essentially, the application needs to upload the ahrefs file (a sample file will be provided) and analyze the list of keywords the user uploads and score them to identify the most promising content opportunities. It should be designed to help you prioritize your content strategy effectively."

## Clarifications

### Session 2024-12-19
- Q: What should be the maximum file size the system can process? ‚Üí A: 10MB maximum (suitable for ~50,000 keywords)
- Q: What export formats should the system support for analysis results? ‚Üí A: JSON only (preserves all calculated fields and structure)
- Q: How should users access the keyword analysis functionality? ‚Üí A: Existing user system integration
- Q: What should be the data retention policy for keyword analysis reports? ‚Üí A: Keep for 90 days then auto-delete
- Q: How should the system handle keywords with missing data? ‚Üí A: Use default values (0 for missing numbers, "unknown" for missing text)
- Q: What is the actual Ahrefs export file format? ‚Üí A: Tab-separated values (TSV) with specific column names: Keyword, Volume, Difficulty, CPC, Intents (comma-separated tags)

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale (<200ms API response requirement)
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements (Google Trends, Ahrefs, Semrush, LLMs)
   - Security/compliance needs
   - User experience and interface requirements
   - Data accuracy and reliability standards

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a content strategist, I want to upload my Ahrefs keyword export file and receive a comprehensive analysis that scores each keyword for content opportunity, so I can prioritize which keywords to target for maximum SEO impact and content strategy effectiveness.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has an Ahrefs keyword export file, **When** they upload it to the system, **Then** the system should parse and validate the file format, and display the total number of keywords found
2. **Given** a valid keyword file has been uploaded, **When** the analysis is triggered, **Then** the system should calculate opportunity scores for each keyword and categorize them as High, Medium, or Low opportunity
3. **Given** the analysis is complete, **When** the user views the results, **Then** they should see a summary report with top opportunities, quick wins, and content recommendations
4. **Given** the user has analyzed keywords, **When** they want to generate content ideas, **Then** the system should use the keyword analysis to create SEO-optimized content ideas with scores

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the uploaded file is not in the expected Ahrefs format?
- How does the system handle keywords with missing data (e.g., no search volume or difficulty score)?
- What happens when all keywords have very low opportunity scores?
- How does the system handle extremely large keyword files (10,000+ keywords)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept file uploads in Ahrefs TSV export format with columns: Keyword, Volume, Difficulty, CPC, Intents
- **FR-002**: System MUST parse and validate uploaded keyword files to ensure required data fields (Keyword, Volume, Difficulty, CPC) are present
