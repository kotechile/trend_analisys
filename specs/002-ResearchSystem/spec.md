# Feature Specification: Trend Analysis & Content Generation Platform

**Feature Branch**: `006-create-a-comprehensive`  
**Created**: 2025-10-02  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create a comprehensive Trend Analysis & Content Generation Platform that allows users to research affiliate programs for topics, analyze trends using external APIs (Google Trends), upload and refine keyword data via CSV files, generate content ideas with SEO recommendations, and schedule content in a calendar. The platform should support multi-LLM integration (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI), provide data visualization, and include a complete user workflow from registration to content publishing."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature description provided and validated
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors (content creators), actions (research, analyze, generate), data (keywords, trends, content), constraints (CSV upload, multi-LLM)
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All aspects clarified - no ambiguities remain
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Complete user workflow from registration to publishing defined
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí 48 testable functional requirements created
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí 6 core entities identified: User, AffiliateResearch, TrendAnalysis, KeywordData, ContentIdeas, ContentCalendar
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí All checks passed - no implementation details, focused on user value
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale (<200ms API response requirement)
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements (Google Trends, Linkup, LLMs)
   - Security/compliance needs
   - User experience and interface requirements
   - Data accuracy and reliability standards

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a content strategist, SEO specialist, or affiliate marketer, I want to streamline my content creation workflow by researching profitable affiliate programs, analyzing market trends, refining keywords from external tools, generating SEO-optimized content ideas, and scheduling content for publication, so that I can make data-driven decisions and maximize my content ROI while saving time and effort.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a new user visits the platform, **When** they register with their email and password, **Then** they receive a confirmation email, can verify their account, and access the main dashboard.

2. **Given** a logged-in user on the dashboard, **When** they enter a topic (e.g., "fitness equipment") and initiate affiliate research, **Then** the system searches for relevant affiliate programs, displays results with commission rates and requirements, and allows the user to bookmark programs of interest.

3. **Given** a user has completed affiliate research, **When** they submit related topics for trend analysis, **Then** the system retrieves trend data from external sources, generates AI-powered insights using multi-LLM integration, identifies sub-topics and content opportunities, and displays visualizations of trend data.

4. **Given** a user has trend analysis results, **When** they provide seed keywords and upload a CSV file from keyword research tools (Ahrefs, Semrush, Moz, etc.) with their selected keywords, **Then** the system validates the CSV format, processes the keyword data (search volumes, difficulty scores), and allows the user to select their top keywords for content generation.

5. **Given** a user has refined keywords, **When** they generate content ideas, **Then** the system creates blog post ideas with SEO-optimized titles, detailed outlines, target audience profiles, and SEO recommendations, all prioritized by potential impact.

6. **Given** a user has generated content ideas, **When** they select ideas and schedule them in the content calendar, **Then** the system creates calendar entries with publication dates, notes, and reminders, allowing the user to manage their content pipeline.

7. **Given** a user is managing their dashboard, **When** they view their analyses history, **Then** they can search, filter, export reports, and delete old analyses as needed.

8. **Given** a user has scheduled content, **When** they access the content calendar, **Then** they can view all scheduled content, update publication status, reschedule entries, and track content performance.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user uploads an invalid CSV file format for keyword data?
- How does the system handle external API failures (Google Trends, LLM services)?
- What happens when a user's affiliate research returns no results for an obscure topic?
- How does the system handle concurrent trend analysis requests from multiple users?
- What happens when a user tries to schedule content for a past date?
- How does the system handle duplicate content ideas or keywords?
- What happens when LLM services are rate-limited or unavailable?
- How does the system handle very large CSV files (10,000+ keywords)?
- What happens when a user's session expires during a long-running analysis?
- How does the system handle conflicting data from different external sources?
