# Feature Specification: Migration Guide Documentation Review

**Feature Branch**: `004-please-review-the`  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Please review the MIGRATION_GUIDE.md located in folder 'docs' to find if anything needs to be updated in the project documentation"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale (<200ms API response requirement)
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements (Google Trends, Ahrefs, Semrush, LLMs)
   - Security/compliance needs
   - User experience and interface requirements
   - Data accuracy and reliability standards

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on the Trend Analysis Platform, I want to review the migration guide against existing project documentation so that I can identify inconsistencies, gaps, and areas that need updating to ensure all documentation is accurate and aligned.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have access to the migration guide and existing project documentation, **When** I compare the migration guide with the implementation plan, **Then** I can identify any timeline or milestone discrepancies
2. **Given** I review the migration guide's architecture section, **When** I compare it with the current project structure, **Then** I can identify any structural differences that need documentation updates
3. **Given** I examine the migration guide's code patterns, **When** I compare them with the current development guide, **Then** I can identify if coding standards and patterns need updating
4. **Given** I review the migration guide's testing strategy, **When** I compare it with the current testing approach, **Then** I can identify if testing documentation needs updates
5. **Given** I check the migration guide's deployment considerations, **When** I compare them with the current deployment documentation, **Then** I can identify if deployment guides need updating

### Edge Cases
- What happens when migration guide references legacy files that no longer exist?
- How does the system handle discrepancies between migration timeline and actual project progress?
- What happens when migration guide contains outdated technology stack information?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
