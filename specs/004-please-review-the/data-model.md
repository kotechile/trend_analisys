- `dependencies`: List of other requirements this depends on

**Relationships**:
- Many-to-one with Documentation Review
- Many-to-one with Migration Guide
- Many-to-one with Project Documentation
- Many-to-one with Documentation Gap
- Many-to-many with other Update Requirements

**Validation Rules**:

## State Transitions

### Documentation Review States
```
pending → in_progress → completed
   ↓           ↓           ↓
 failed ← failed ← failed
```

### Migration Guide States
```
draft → review → approved → published
  ↓       ↓         ↓         ↓
archived ← archived ← archived ← archived
```

### Update Requirement States
```
identified → planned → in_progress → completed
     ↓          ↓          ↓           ↓
  rejected ← rejected ← rejected ← rejected
```

## Data Validation Rules

### Cross-Entity Validation
1. All `gap_id` references in Update Requirement must exist in Documentation Gap
2. All `doc_id` references in Documentation Gap must exist in Project Documentation
3. All `guide_id` references in Documentation Gap must exist in Migration Guide
4. All `requirement_id` references in Update Requirement dependencies must exist in Update Requirement

### Business Logic Validation
1. Documentation Review cannot be completed if there are unresolved critical gaps
2. Update Requirements cannot be implemented if their dependencies are not completed
3. Migration Guide version must be incremented when updates are applied
4. Documentation Review must include at least one finding to be considered complete

### Data Integrity Constraints
1. No orphaned Documentation Gaps (must reference valid documentation)
2. No circular dependencies in Update Requirements
3. All file paths must be valid and accessible
4. All timestamps must be in chronological order
5. All version numbers must follow semantic versioning

## Performance Considerations

### Indexing Strategy
- Primary keys on all entity IDs
- Composite indexes on frequently queried combinations
- Full-text indexes on description and content fields
- Hash indexes on file paths and content hashes

### Caching Strategy
- Cache frequently accessed documentation content
- Cache review results for quick reference
- Cache dependency graphs for efficient traversal
- Cache validation results to avoid repeated checks

### Query Optimization
- Use pagination for large result sets
- Implement efficient search across documentation
- Optimize dependency resolution queries
- Cache expensive validation operations
