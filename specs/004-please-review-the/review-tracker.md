## Issues Found

### Critical Issues (Priority 1)
1. **Timeline Misalignment**: Migration guide shows 8-week timeline vs 10-13 week implementation plan
2. **Structure Differences**: Migration guide references `backend/app/` vs current `backend/src/`
3. **Missing Legacy References**: References to non-existent `legacy-reference/python-code/` directory

### High Priority Issues (Priority 2)
4. **Outdated Technology Stack**: Basic stack vs detailed current technology decisions
5. **Testing Strategy Gap**: Basic approach vs comprehensive TDD approach
6. **Missing API Contracts**: No current API specifications included
7. **Missing Database Schema**: No current data models and RLS policies

### Medium Priority Issues (Priority 3)
8. **Missing Security Standards**: No current security and performance requirements
9. **Missing Integration Specs**: No current external API integration details
10. **Missing Deployment Details**: No current CI/CD pipeline information
