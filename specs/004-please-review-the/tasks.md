# Tasks: Migration Guide Documentation Review

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/004-please-review-the/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → If not found: ERROR "No implementation plan found"
   → Extract: tech stack, libraries, structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: Each file → contract test task
   → research.md: Extract decisions → setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project init, dependencies, linting, monorepo structure
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests (TDD mandatory)
   → Core: models, services, CLI commands
   → Integration: DB, middleware, logging, external APIs (Google Trends, Ahrefs, Semrush)
   → UI/UX: React components, user interface, accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)
   → Polish: unit tests, performance (<200ms), docs, security audits
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All contracts have tests?
   → All entities have models?
   → All endpoints implemented?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts
- Focus on documentation review and migration guide updates
- Ensure constitutional compliance throughout

## Task Generation Rules
*Applied during main() execution*

1. **From Contracts**:
   - Each contract file → contract test task [P]
   - Each endpoint → implementation task
   
2. **From Data Model**:
   - Each entity → model creation task [P]
   - Relationships → service layer tasks
   
3. **From User Stories**:
   - Each story → integration test [P]
   - Quickstart scenarios → validation tasks

4. **Ordering**:
   - Setup → Tests → Models → Services → Endpoints → Integration → Migration Updates → Validation → Polish
   - Dependencies block parallel execution

## Validation Checklist
*GATE: Checked by main() before returning*

- [x] All contracts have corresponding tests
- [x] All entities have model tasks
- [x] All tests come before implementation
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [x] Migration guide update tasks are comprehensive
- [x] All critical issues from research are addressed
- [x] Constitutional compliance is maintained throughout

## Critical Migration Guide Updates Required

Based on research findings, the following critical updates must be implemented:

1. **Timeline Alignment** (T043): Update 8-week timeline to 10-13 week timeline
2. **Structure Correction** (T044): Fix backend/app/ → backend/src/ references
3. **Legacy References** (T045): Verify and update legacy-reference/python-code/ paths
4. **Technology Stack** (T046): Integrate current technology decisions
5. **Testing Strategy** (T047): Align with current TDD approach
6. **API Contracts** (T048): Add current API specifications
7. **Database Schema** (T049): Include current data models
8. **Security Standards** (T050): Add current security requirements
9. **Integration Specs** (T051): Include current external API details
10. **Deployment Details** (T052): Add current CI/CD pipeline information

*This task list provides a comprehensive roadmap for updating the migration guide documentation to align with current project state.*
