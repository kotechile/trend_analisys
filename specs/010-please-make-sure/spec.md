# Feature Specification: Complete Dataflow Persistence in Supabase

**Feature Branch**: `010-please-make-sure`  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Please make sure that the full dtataflow's data needs to be persisted in Supabase. The Research topics should persist in the Supabase database in cluding a Research Id and a topic description. Evert Topic Description is split into sub-topics plus the original topic as a sub toipic too.  The sub topics can have Trend analisys. The selected Trend analysis is exploded into ideas of different types . All this informatioin needs to be persisted in Supabase."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale (<200ms API response requirement)
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements (Google Trends, Ahrefs, Semrush, LLMs)
   - Security/compliance needs
   - User experience and interface requirements
   - Data accuracy and reliability standards

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a content researcher, I want all my research data to be automatically saved in the database so that I can access my complete research history, continue interrupted workflows, and build upon previous analysis without losing any work.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user starts a research session with a topic, **When** they complete topic decomposition, **Then** the research topic, research ID, and all generated subtopics (including the original topic as a subtopic) must be persisted in Supabase
2. **Given** a user selects subtopics for trend analysis, **When** trend analysis is performed, **Then** the trend analysis results must be linked to the specific subtopics and persisted in Supabase
3. **Given** trend analysis results are available, **When** the user generates content ideas, **Then** all content ideas of different types must be linked to the trend analysis and persisted in Supabase
4. **Given** a user has completed research, **When** they return to the system later, **Then** they must be able to view their complete research history and continue from any point
5. **Given** data is being persisted, **When** any step fails, **Then** the system must maintain data integrity and provide clear error messages about what was saved and what failed

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the database connection is lost during data persistence?
- How does the system handle partial data saves when a workflow is interrupted?
- What occurs when a user tries to access research data that was partially saved due to an error?
- How does the system handle concurrent access to the same research data by multiple users?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST persist every research topic with a unique Research ID and topic description in Supabase
- **FR-002**: System MUST store the original topic as a subtopic along with all AI-generated subtopics in the topic decomposition
- **FR-003**: System MUST link each subtopic to its parent research topic through foreign key relationships
- **FR-004**: System MUST persist trend analysis results and link them to specific subtopics in Supabase
- **FR-005**: System MUST store all content ideas generated from trend analysis with their type classification
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain referential integrity between research topics, subtopics, trend analyses, and content ideas
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide data retrieval capabilities to reconstruct the complete research workflow from any point
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle data persistence failures gracefully without losing previously saved data
- **FR-009**: System MUST support data versioning to track changes in research topics and subtopics over time
- **FR-010**: System MUST enable users to query and filter their research data by topic, subtopic, analysis type, or content idea type

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Research Topic**: Core entity representing the main research subject with unique ID, description, and metadata
- **Subtopic**: Individual topic subdivisions including the original topic, with relationships to parent research topic and trend analyses
- **Trend Analysis**: Analysis results linked to specific subtopics, containing trend data, insights, and metadata
- **Content Ideas**: Generated content concepts of various types, linked to trend analyses and containing detailed specifications
- **Research Session**: Workflow session that groups related research activities and maintains state across the research process
