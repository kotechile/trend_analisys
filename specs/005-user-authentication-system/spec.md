## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale (<200ms API response requirement)
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements (Google Trends, Ahrefs, Semrush, LLMs)
   - Security/compliance needs
   - User experience and interface requirements
   - Data accuracy and reliability standards

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user of the Trend Analysis Platform, I want to create an account, log in securely, and access features based on my role, so that I can use the platform's affiliate research, trend analysis, and content generation capabilities while maintaining data privacy and security.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new user visits the platform, **When** they click "Register", **Then** they can create an account with email and password, and receive a confirmation email.
2. **Given** a registered user, **When** they enter valid credentials, **Then** they are logged in and redirected to the dashboard with appropriate access based on their role.
3. **Given** a logged-in user, **When** they click "Logout", **Then** their session is terminated and they are redirected to the login page.
4. **Given** a user with admin role, **When** they access user management features, **Then** they can view and manage other users' accounts.
5. **Given** a user with regular role, **When** they try to access admin features, **Then** they receive an access denied message.
6. **Given** a user who forgot their password, **When** they request a password reset, **Then** they receive a secure reset link via email.
7. **Given** a user with an expired session, **When** they try to access protected features, **Then** they are redirected to login with a session expired message.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to register with an email that already exists?
- How does the system handle multiple failed login attempts?
- What happens when a user's session expires while they're using the platform?
- How does the system handle password reset requests for non-existent accounts?
- What happens when a user tries to access the platform from multiple devices simultaneously?
- How does the system handle malformed or invalid JWT tokens?
